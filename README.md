📊 Blinkit Data Analysis using Python
This project presents a data analysis case study on Blinkit (formerly Grofers)—an Indian instant delivery service. The objective is to derive meaningful insights from customer orders, product preferences, delivery patterns, and operational performance using Python.

🔍 Objectives
Understand customer ordering patterns and preferences.

Identify top-selling products and categories.

Analyze delivery time trends and service bottlenecks.

Explore city-wise operational performance.

Suggest data-driven business improvements.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

NumPy – Numerical computations

Jupyter Notebook – Exploratory analysis

📦 Dataset
The dataset includes:

Order ID, User ID, Product ID

Order Timestamp

Delivery Time

Product Category

Price, Discount, Final Amount

City, Payment Type, etc.

Note: This is a simulated dataset for analysis purposes only.

📈 Key Insights
📌 Most orders are placed during evening hours.

🛒 "Fruits & Vegetables" and "Dairy" are the top categories.

🚚 Average delivery time is 22 minutes; delays spike during weekends.

🌍 Tier-1 cities show higher order volumes but lower per-order value.

💳 COD still dominates despite UPI adoption.
